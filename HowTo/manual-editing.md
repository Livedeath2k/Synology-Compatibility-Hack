# Manual Approach of the Synology Compatibility Hack
It's a hack to disable the compatibilty check of some synology devices.
It's tested with Version DSM 7.0.1-42218 on a RS2821rp+ NAS.

## HowTo

In my Example i'm using windows with putty and scp.
Change YOURSYNOLOGYIP to the ip of your Synology Device like 192.168.123.123.

1. Enable SSH on your Synology Device
2. Login via SSh in your Synology Device
3. cd /var/lib/disk-compatibility
4. make a copy of the directory on your local hard drive for backup purposes  
   example: ```scp admin@YOURSYNOLOGYIP:/var/lib/disk-compatibility/*.* c:\temp```
5. change the filename of my rs2821rp+_host_v7.db to your device model
6. Inside the file change "MZ7LH1T9HMLT-00005" to your Harddrive model and change "HXT7904Q" to your Harddrive firmware. Change the Model of the NAS Model in "nas_model":"rs2821rp+" to your NAS. Save afterwards.
7. copy the file via scp to /tmp on your Synology Device  
   example: ```scp c:\temp\rs2821rp+_host_v7.db admin@YOURSYNOLOGYIP:/tmp/rs2821rp+_host_v7.db```
8. overwrite the existing file via sudo cp  
   example: ```sudo cp /tmp/rs2821rp+_host_v7.db /var/lib/disk-compatibility/rs2821rp+_host_v7.db```
9. reboot your Synology Device
10. Check your Harddisk Status

### If it won't work
11. copy the files eunit_rule.db and host_rule.db over the existing files on your Synology Device.
12. Reboot your Synology Device
13. Check your Harddisk Status
